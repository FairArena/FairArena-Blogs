## System Overview

FairArena is built as a modular, high-performance platform designed to handle complex skill assessment workflows. Our architecture prioritizes **scalability**, **type safety**, and **observability**.

## Core Components

### 1. The Monolithic Core (Express + Prisma)

While we advocate for modularity, our core business logic resides in a robust Express.js monolith. This ensures strong transactional integrity for sensitive operations like billing and team management.

- **ORM**: Prisma for type-safe database access.
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime schema validation.

### 2. Event-Driven Workflows (Inngest)

Background processing is handled by Inngest. We have over **34 event functions** handling everything from sending emails to AI model inference.

- **Reliability**: Automatic retries and active dead-letter queues.
- **Serverless**: Functions run independently of the main API loop.

### 3. Data Layer (Postgres + Redis)

- **Primary DB**: PostgreSQL 15 running in high-availability mode with read replicas.
- **Cache**: Redis 7 used for session storage, rate limiting counters, and API response caching.

## Security Controls

Our security model follows a defense-in-depth strategy:

1.  **Transport**: All internal services communicate over mTLS.
2.  **Edge**: Arcjet provides WAF capabilities and bot protection.
3.  **Application**: Strict RBAC implemented via Clerk and custom middleware.

## Deployment Pipeline

We utilize a GitOps workflow. Every commit to `main` triggers a build pipeline in GitHub Actions, which:

1.  Runs unit and integration tests.
2.  Builds Docker containers.
3.  Deploys to our staging environment for E2E testing.
